I use  the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset that contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of hand-written and labeled digits, 0 through 9, so ten total "classes." The MNIST dataset has the images, which are purely black and white, thresholded, images, of size 28 x 28, or 784 pixels total.
